# Compliance Crew Coordinator

Forge app for **Codegeist 2025: Atlassian Williams Racing Edition**.

Compliance Crew Coordinator turns your Atlassian cloud site into an F1-style pit wall for risk & compliance teams. It scans Jira issues and Confluence pages for potential problems (GDPR, SOX, DORA, etc.), flags them with red/yellow/green “race flags,” and coordinates follow-up work across teams.

## Features (MVP)

- 🔍 Inline audits in Jira & Confluence
- 🚩 Red / yellow / green “flag” risk levels
- 🧑‍💼 “Pit wall” dashboard for compliance & risk leads
- 🤖 Optional AI/Rovo assistance for remediation suggestions

## Tech stack

- Atlassian Forge (Custom UI / UI Kit)
- Jira Cloud & Confluence Cloud
- Node.js (Forge functions)
- Optional: external AI service for compliance insights
